# Porting notes

Deviations from the HolyC original, known gaps, and findings made while
porting. Newest first; entries are dated. Starts with what is known before any
Go is written.

## 2026-09-21: known before the port starts

- **Regression coverage gap.** The TempleOS regression scenario
  (`contract/tests/full-regression.hc`) does not exercise `revert`,
  `reconcile`, `path close` or `operation restore`. In the port these are
  covered by unit tests only; `revert` and `reconcile` share code with
  `correct`. Any divergence found later is the trigger to extend the scenario.
- **`Fossil.HC` is a pure algorithm.** It implements Fossil's delta format and
  ports directly; it is not a TempleOS file layer.
- **DolDoc views are not reproduced.** `historydoc`, `reconciledoc`,
  `conflictdoc` and `graph` are ported as plain-text/ANSI output carrying the
  same information, not the same rendering.
- **Atomic writes are a native-side choice.** TempleOS wrote repo files
  directly; the port writes a temp file and renames. This does not change the
  format.
- **Fixtures are final-state.** `expected.log` is one output stream from a
  single scenario, so command output is checked by re-running the scenario
  (pillar B), not by running each command against a fixture.
